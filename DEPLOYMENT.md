# 🚀 SafeAlert Rwanda - Deployment Guide

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Database credentials secured (✅ **DONE**)
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Build process tested
- [ ] Deployment platform chosen

---

## 🛠️ **STEP 1: Set Up Your Database**

### Option A: Use Existing Neon Database

You already have a Neon database connection. Get your connection string:

1. Go to [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Connection Details"
4. Copy the connection string (starts with `postgresql://`)

### Option B: Create New Neon Database

1. Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the connection string

---

## 🔧 **STEP 2: Configure Environment Variables**

### For Local Development:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your database URL
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string_here
```

### For Production (Netlify):

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Site Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add these variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = your Neon connection string
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### For Production (Vercel):

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Project Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add the same variables as above

---

## 🚀 **STEP 3: Deploy Your Application**

### Option A: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)

#### Method 1: Drag & Drop

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The dist/spa folder will be created
# Drag this folder to Netlify's deploy zone
```

#### Method 2: Git Integration

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build:client`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist/spa`
   - **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`

### Option B: Deploy to Vercel

1. Push code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Vercel will auto-detect settings
4. Add environment variables in settings

---

## 🧪 **STEP 4: Test Your Deployment**

After deployment, test these features:

- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Map displays correctly
- [ ] Language toggle works
- [ ] Emergency reporting form works
- [ ] Authentication system works
- [ ] Database connection works

---

## 🔧 **STEP 5: Domain & SSL**

Both Netlify and Vercel provide:

- ✅ Free SSL certificates
- ✅ CDN distribution
- ✅ Custom domain support

To add a custom domain:

1. Go to Domain Settings in your platform
2. Add your domain (e.g., `safealert.rw`)
3. Update DNS records as instructed

---

## 🛡️ **Security Checklist**

- [x] Database credentials secured with environment variables
- [x] Error boundaries added for production
- [x] HTTPS enforced (handled by Netlify/Vercel)
- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] CORS configured if needed

---

## 📊 **Monitoring & Maintenance**

### Error Monitoring (Optional but Recommended)

Consider adding error monitoring:

- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) - Error tracking
- [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/) - Session recording
- [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) - User analytics

### Performance Monitoring

- Both Netlify and Vercel provide analytics
- Use Lighthouse for performance audits
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

#### "Database connection failed"

- ✅ Check DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- ✅ Verify Neon database is running
- ✅ Check SSL settings in connection string

#### "Environment variable not found"

- ✅ Verify variables are set in deployment platform
- ✅ Check variable names match exactly
- ✅ Redeploy after setting variables

#### "Build failed"

- ✅ Run `npm run build` locally first
- ✅ Check for TypeScript errors
- ✅ Verify all dependencies are in package.json

#### "Functions not working"

- ✅ Check Netlify functions are deployed
- ✅ Verify API routes in `netlify/functions/`
- ✅ Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

---

## 🎯 **Quick Deploy Commands**

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build
npm run start

# If everything works, deploy!
# For Netlify: Drag dist/spa folder or connect Git
# For Vercel: Push to connected Git repository
```

---

## 📞 **Need Help?**

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check deployment platform logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test database connection separately

**Emergency Deployment Support:**

- Database issues → Check Neon Console
- Build issues → Run commands locally first
- Function issues → Check platform logs
